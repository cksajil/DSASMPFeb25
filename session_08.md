# Linear Algebra
## Key Concepts
## Scalars
## Vectors
- Push or force in certain direction
- Lives in an abstract vector space
- Direction in abstract sense
- Can be 2D, 3D, ..., ND
- Notation basics
- Row vector, column vector
- Basis of vector
    - In terms of fundamental components: linear independance
    - Changing of basis
- Distance of a point from origin
- Magnitude/norms of vectors $L_1$ and $L_2$ norm, $L_p$ norm
- Unit vector
- Distance between points
    - Euclidean distance
    - Manhattan distance
- Dot product of vectors
    - $a \cdot b = \sum_i a_i b_i$
    - $a \cdot b = \Vert a\Vert \Vert b \Vert \cos \theta$
    - Angle between two vectors
    - Concept of orthogonality
- General equation of line/plain
    - why weights of general forms normal to the plane

- Operations on vectors
    - Projection of a vector $a$ into vector $b$ 
    - $d = \frac{a \cdot b}{\Vert b \Vert} = \frac{\Vert a \Vert \Vert b \Vert \cos \theta}{\Vert b \Vert} = \Vert a \Vert \cos \theta$

- Matrices as Transformation on vectors
- Matrix multiplication as reversible/irreversible AB!=BA
- Inverse of Matrix
- Eigen values and eigen vectors
- Matrix Factorization
    - SVD/UV
